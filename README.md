# FanAdapter
OpenSCAD script to create fan adapters for various purposes that can be 3d printed.  

Also includes a separate script to generate a gasket, which can be useful to improve sealing efficiency with fans that have unusual chassis geometry.  
It is recommended to be printed with flexible filament, TPU 95A works great.
